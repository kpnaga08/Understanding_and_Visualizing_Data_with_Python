# # The Empirical Rule and Distribution
# 
# In week 2, we discussed the empirical rule or the 68 - 95 - 99.7 rule, which describes how many observations fall within a certain distance from our mean.  This distance from the mean is denoted as sigma, or standard deviation (the average distance an observation is from the mean).
# 
# The following image may help refresh your memory:
# 
# ![Three Sigma Rule](img/three_sigma_rule.png)
# 
# For this tutorial, we will be exploring the number of hours the average college student gets.
# 
# The example used in lecture stated there was a mean of 7 and standard deviation of 1.7 for hours of sleep; we will use these same values.

# Now that we have covered the 68 - 95 - 99.7 rule, we will take this a step further and discuss the empirical distribution.
# 
# The empirical distribution is a cumulative density function that signifies the proportion of observations that are less than or equal to a certain values.
# 
# Lets use the initial image above as an example of this concept:

# 
# Now, by using our observations for ours of sleep, we can create an empirical distribution in python that signifies the proportion of observations are observed at a specific number for hours of sleep.
