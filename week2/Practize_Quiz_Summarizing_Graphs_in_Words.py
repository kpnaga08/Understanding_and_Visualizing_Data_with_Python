Deli A
Deli B
Deli C
Deli D
Can't tell

Answer: Deli A
Since the minimum of Deli A is at least 460 and the maximum is at most 540, the maximum possible range is 80.  
This is smaller than all of the other options.


Question 6
Which is larger for Deli C?

The mean
The median
They are the same
Can't tell

Answer: The mean
Because Deli C's histogram of sandwiches ordered is skewed right, that will pull the mean higher than the median.


Question 7
The following graph shows the service time for customers at five delis.  
What approximate proportion of customers are waiting for more than 12 minutes for their sandwich at Deli A?

25%
30%
50%
75%
Can't tell


Answer: 50%
Because the middle line of the box is around 12, we know that approximately half of the customers will wait for more than 12 minutes for their sandwich to be served.


Question 8
Which deli's service time distribution has the smallest mean?

Deli A
Deli B
Deli C
Deli D
Deli E

Answer: Deli C
We can't fully answer this question because means are not incorporated into boxplots, so we can not determine which mean is largest or smallest. 
However, based on the location of all of the data points and because each location in Deli C's boxplot is smaller, we can tell that Deli C has the smallest mean.
