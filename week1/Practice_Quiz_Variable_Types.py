# Practice Quiz - Variable Types

Question 1
The following five questions are focused around a startup company. Management is trying to gain insight on current employees and have sent out a short anonymous survey to them. Read each prompt carefully and determine the variable type for each question.
Employees were asked to report their typical daily commute time, in minutes. What type of variable would their response be considered?


Categorical Nominal
Categorical Ordinal
Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative Discrete

Answer: Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative variables are numeric, measurable quantities - such as time. The variable is continuous because it can take on a very large range of values. An employee's commute time could be 20 minutes, 47.5 minutes, or a broad range of other options.


Question 2
Employees were asked to report their typical daily mode of transportation to and from work (i.e. Car, Bike, Bus, etc.). 
What type of variable would their response be considered?


Categorical Nominal
Categorical Ordinal
Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative Discrete

Answer: Categorical Nominal
Nominal variables consist of groups or names in which there is no inherent ordering. 
Here, employees can be grouped by the specific mode of transportation and these groups have no inherent ranking or ordering.


Question 3
The company wanted to know how employees perceived the work of upper management. 
Employees were asked to report the satisfaction of upper management using a 1 to 5 scale (with the following representations: 1 - Extremely Unsatisfied, 2 - Unsatisfied, 3 - Neutral, 4 - Satisfied, 5 - Extremely Satisfied). 
What type of variable would their response be considered?


Categorical Nominal
Categorical Ordinal
Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative Discrete

Answer: Categorical Ordinal
Ordinal variables consist of groups or names with an inherent ordering or ranking. 
Here, employees group their satisfaction into one of five categories and these categories have a specific ranking.


Question 4
It was reported that Fridays were generally lighter in terms of number of meetings held. 
Employees were asked to report the number of scheduled meetings they attended the previous Friday. 
What type of variable would their response be considered?


Categorical Nominal
Categorical Ordinal
Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative Discrete

Answer: Quantitative Discrete
Quantitative discrete variables are measurable quantities with a small set of countable values. 
Here, we are measuring the number of meetings attended in a single day and realistically you can only attend so many scheduled meetings in one workday (probably somewhere between 0 and 10 or so).


Question 5
Management was playing around with the idea of having a food truck visit the office once a week and was trying to gauge how much employees would spend to help entice various food truck owners. 
Employees were asked to report the amount of money they believe they would spend on lunch (in $XX.XX) if a food truck came to the office once a week. 
What type of variable would their response be considered?

Categorical Nominal
Categorical Ordinal
Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative Discrete

Answer: Quantitative Continuous
Quantitative variables are numeric, measurable quantities. 
The variable is continuous because it can take on a very large range of values. 
An employee could be willing to spend $4.80, $15.50, or a very broad range of other options.
